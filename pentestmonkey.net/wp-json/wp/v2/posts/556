There are times, however when the client might expect you find a free IP on your own. Or you might want to check that the client hasn&#8217;t assigned you an IP address that&#8217;s already in use.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all got our own techniques for doing this. Each will have a greater or lesser risk of causing a temporary IP clash. This post explores some ways that we can minimise the risk picking an IP address that&#8217;s in use.<\/p>\n<p>I make heavy use of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nta-monitor.com\/tools\/arp-scan\/\">arp-scan<\/a> during the explanation below and also use the fingerprint database of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nta-monitor.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Arp-scan_User_Guide#Using_arp-scan_for_system_fingerprinting\">arp-fingerprint<\/a>. So, thanks upfront to arp-scan&#8217;s author, Roy Hills for a very useful tool and comprehensive database that made this blog post much quicker to write than it otherwise would have been. That said, this post isn&#8217;t really about tools, just a methodology for finding a free IP address.<\/p>\n<h2>Network Sniffing<\/h2>\n<p>If you find yourself on a network and DHCP fails, your best course of action is probably to sniff on the network for a while (e.g. with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tcpdump.org\/\">tcpdump<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wireshark.org\/\">wireshark<\/a>). Hopefully you&#8217;ll seem some broadcast traffic that will give you an idea of some of the IP addresses in use.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of an example, let&#8217;s assume we&#8217;ve seen traffic from 10.0.0.1.<\/p>\n<h2>Guess a Network Range<\/h2>\n<p>Now guess a netmask in which you&#8217;ll search for a free IP address &#8211; you can always expand the network range later when you&#8217;ve found a free IP and want to start your pentest. Perhaps start by assuming a Class C network, so we&#8217;re looking to find the free IPs in 10.0.0.0\/24.<\/p>\n<h2>Use ARP Queries to Identify IPs in Use<\/h2>\n<p>This is the main point of the post. It seems that a few well chose ARP requests will mean that your probing is both effective and minimises the chances of causing an IP clash.<\/p>\n<p>We know that we need to scan 10.0.0.0\/24, but what should we choose as our source IP address? Arp-fingerprint&#8217;s database indicates that the following would be good choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>127.0.0.1<\/li>\n<li>0.0.0.0<\/li>\n<li>255.255.255.255<\/li>\n<li>1.0.0.1 (IP network 1.0.0.0\/8 is reserved by IANA)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So the corresponding arp-scan commands would be:<\/p>\n<pre> arp-scan --arpspa=127.0.0.1 10.0.0.0\/24\r\n arp-scan --arpspa=0.0.0.0 10.0.0.0\/24\r\n arp-scan --arpspa=255.255.255.255 10.0.0.0\/24\r\n arp-scan --arpspa=1.0.0.1 10.0.0.0\/24<\/pre>\n<p>But how effective is this going to be? Do systems generally respond to at least one of these probes? According to arp-fingerprint&#8217;s database, most OSs we&#8217;re likely to encounter will respond. Below is an extract from arp-fingerprint&#8217;s database (arp-scan v1.8.1). The OSs below where one of the first 4 digits is a &#8220;1&#8221; should be detected:<\/p>\n<pre> my %fp_hash = (\r\n '11110100000' =&gt; 'FreeBSD 5.3, 7.0, DragonflyBSD 2.0, Win98, WinME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Catalyst IOS 12.0, 12.1, 12.2, FortiOS 3.00',\r\n '01000100000' =&gt; 'Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6',\r\n '01010100000' =&gt; 'Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, Vista, 2008, Windows7', # Linux only if non-local IP is routed\r\n '00000100000' =&gt; 'Cisco IOS 11.2, 11.3, 12.0, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4',\r\n '11110110000' =&gt; 'Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, HP-UX 11',\r\n '01000111111' =&gt; 'ScreenOS 5.0, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4',\r\n '11110000000' =&gt; 'Linux 2.0, MacOS 10.4, IPSO 3.2.1, Minix 3, Cisco VPN Concentrator 4.7, Catalyst 1900',\r\n '11110100011' =&gt; 'MacOS 10.3, FreeBSD 4.3, IRIX 6.5, AIX 4.3, AIX 5.3',\r\n '10010100011' =&gt; 'SCO OS 5.0.7',\r\n '10110100000' =&gt; 'Win 3.11, 95, NT 3.51',\r\n '11110000011' =&gt; '2.11BSD, 4.3BSD, OpenBSD 3.1, OpenBSD 3.9, Nortel Contivity 6.00, 6.05',\r\n '10110110000' =&gt; 'NetBSD 2.0.2, 4.0',\r\n '10110111111' =&gt; 'PIX OS 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3',\r\n '11110111111' =&gt; 'PIX OS 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, ScreenOS 5.0 (transparent), Plan9, Blackberry OS',\r\n '00010110011' =&gt; 'PIX OS 6.3, 7.0(1), 7.0(2)',\r\n '01010110011' =&gt; 'PIX OS 7.0(4)-7.0(6), 7.1, 7.2, 8.0',\r\n '00000110000' =&gt; 'Netware 6.5',\r\n '00010100000' =&gt; 'Unknown 1', # 14805 79.253 Cisco\r\n '00000110011' =&gt; 'Cisco IP Phone 79xx SIP 5.x,6.x,7.x',\r\n '11110110011' =&gt; 'Cisco IP Phone 79xx SIP 8.x', # Also 14805 63.11 Fujitsu Siemens\r\n );<\/pre>\n<p>So by covering pretty much every version of Windows, Linux and Solaris, we&#8217;ve covered most of the servers and workstations types we&#8217;re likely to encounter on pentests (or at least the main ones that I encounter).
