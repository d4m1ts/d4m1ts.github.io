This allows tests to be resumed\r\n  relatively efficiently if they're interrupted.\r\n* Auto-parse scan results into the database.\r\n  run_test API now has an option to specify a parser that\r\n  will be run on on the output file.  These script now\r\n  auto-parse, so the parsers aren't called from\r\n  yaptest-db-ips.sh:\r\n        yaptest-yapscan-icmp.pl\r\n        yaptest-yapscan-tcp.pl\r\n        yaptest-rpcinfo.pl\r\n        yaptest-onesixtyone.pl\r\n        yaptest-enum4linux.pl\r\n        yaptest-snmpwalk.pl\r\n        yaptest-password-guess-ftp.pl\r\n        yaptest-password-guess-mssql.pl\r\n        yaptest-password-guess-rlogin.pl\r\n        yaptest-password-guess-smb.pl\r\n        yaptest-password-guess-ssh.pl\r\n        yaptest-arp-scan-local-network.pl\r\n* Added yaptest-host-info.pl.  This can be used to store\r\n  arbitrary info about a host in key\/value format.  Currently\r\n  used for tracking OS, Windows domain, Domain controllers,\r\n  Device type, SNMP system description.\r\n* \"make checkdep\" is now supported to check for missing\r\n  external programs and PERL modules.\r\n* yaptest-yapscan-tcp.pl now breaks scans into chunks and\r\n  run scans on custom port ranges.  The smaller chunks help\r\n  to resume scans more efficiently.\r\n* Added yaptest-password-guess-mysql.pl to guess passwords\r\n  against any mysql servers found.\r\n* Most password guessing is not turned off in\r\n  yaptest-db-ips.sh to avoid locking accounts out.\r\n* yaptest-enum4linux.pl now uses version 0.8.0 which takes\r\n  different command line args and does more thorough enumeration.\r\n* yaptest-groups.pl can now parse group info from enum4linux\r\n  output.  This is incredibly helpful when attacking large\r\n  Windows domains.\r\n* yaptest-ports.pl now support querying of ports based on\r\n  nmap version string (e.g. 'Apache').\r\n* yaptest-parse-onesixtyone.pl now stores system descrition\r\n  as \"host-info\" and recognises jetdirect systems as having\r\n  device_type = printer.\r\n* rpcinfo-based tests use RPC number instead of name incase\r\n  users don't have a good \/etc\/rpc file.\r\n* Optimised yaptest-db-ips.sh to do the interesting stuff\r\n  first.\r\n* Nmap TCP scans use --version-all so nmap does a better job\r\n  of identifying strange ports.  This is slower, but is\r\n  important because so many scripts rely on what nmap finds.\r\n* Lots of schema enhancements to support current and future\r\n  features.\r\n* yaptest-parse-nbtscan.pl added to store hostname,\r\n  domain membership and domain controller info in backend\r\n  database.\r\n* Added ASCII art to yaptest-wizard.pl :-)<\/pre>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yaptest has had a lot of new features added over the last few months and I&#8217;m stuggling to get them all written up and released.\u00a0 v0.0.7 is the first of several releases.\u00a0 Download yaptest v0.0.7 here .
