1<\/h3>\n<p>The SSH server will be able to access TCP port 80 on the SSH client by connecting to 127.0.0.1:8000 on the SSH server.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Command line:<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre>ssh

172.16.0.99:80<\/pre>\n<h2>Configuration Files<\/h2>\n<h3>~\/.ssh\/config<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s sometimes easier to configure options on your SSH client system in ~\/.ssh\/config for hosts you use a lot rather than having to type out long command lines.<\/p>\n<p>Using ~\/.ssh\/config also makes it easier to use other tools that use SSH (e.g. scp and rsync). \u00a0It&#8217;s possible to tell other tools that SSH listens on a different port, but it&#8217;s a pain.<\/p>\n<pre>Host 10.0.0.1\r\nPort 2222\r\nUser ptm\r\nForwardX11 yes\r\nDynamicForward 127.0.0.1:1080\r\nRemoteForward 80 127.0.0.1:8000\r\nLocalForward 1521 10.0.0.99:1521<\/pre>\n<p>The above lines are explained more fully in the other subsection on this page.<\/p>\n<h3>~\/.ssh\/authozied_keys<\/h3>\n<p>During a pentest or audit, you might want to add an authorized_keys file to let you log in using an SSH key.<\/p>\n<p>The authorized_keys file lives in a user&#8217;s home directory on the SSH server. \u00a0It holds the public keys of the users allowed to log into that user&#8217;s account.<\/p>\n<p>Generate a public\/private key pair like this:<\/p>\n<pre>ssh-keygen -f mykey\r\ncat mykey.pub # you can copy this to authorized_keys<\/pre>\n<p>If you want to shortest possible key (because your arbitrary-file-write vector is limited), do this:<\/p>\n<pre>ssh-keygen -f mykey -t rsa -b 768\r\ncat mykey.pub # copy to authorized_key. \u00a0Omit the trailing user@host if you need a shorter key.<\/pre>\n<p>Connect to the target system like this (you need to know the username of the user you added an authorized key for):<\/p>\n<pre>ssh -i mykey user@10.0.0.1<\/pre>\n<p>Caveat: The authorized_keys file might not work if it&#8217;s writable by other users. \u00a0If you already have shell access you can &#8220;chmod 600 ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys&#8221;. \u00a0However, if you&#8217;re remotely exploiting an arbitrary file-write vulnerability and happen to have a weak umask, you may have problems.<\/p>\n<h2>X11 Forwarding<\/h2>\n<p>If your SSH client is also an X-Server then you can launch X-clients (e.g. Firefox) inside your SSH session and display them on your X-Server. \u00a0This works well with from Linux X-Servers and from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cygwin.com\/\">cygwin<\/a>&#8216;s X-server on Windows.<\/p>\n<h3>Command Line:<\/h3>\n<pre>SSH -X 10.0.0.1\r\nSSH -Y 10.0.0.1 # less secure alternative - but faster<\/pre>\n<h3>~\/.ssh\/config:<\/h3>\n<pre>ForwardX11 yes\r\nForwardX11Trusted yes # less secure alternative - but faster<\/pre>\n<h2>SSH Agents<\/h2>\n<p>SSH agents can be used to hold your private SSH keys in memory. \u00a0The agent will then authenticate you to any hosts that trust your SSH key.<\/p>\n<p>This has the following advantages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don&#8217;t have to keep entering your passphrase (if you chose to encrypt your private key)<\/li>\n<li>But you still get to store your private SSH key in an encrypted format on disk.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Using an SSH agent is probably more secure than storing your key in cleartext, but agents can be hijacked.<\/p>\n<h3>Using an SSH Agent<\/h3>\n<p>First start your agent:<\/p>\n<pre>eval `ssh-agent`<\/pre>\n<p>Then add your keys to it &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to enter your passphrase for any encrypted keys:<\/p>\n<pre>ssh-add ~\/dir\/mykey<\/pre>\n<h3>Hijacking SSH Agents<\/h3>\n<p>If you see SSH agents running on a pentest (process called &#8220;ssh-agent&#8221;), you might be able to use it to authenticate you to other hosts &#8211; or other accounts on that host. \u00a0Check out ~\/.ssh\/known_hosts for some ideas of where you might be able to connect to.<\/p>\n<p>You can use any agents running under the account you compromised. \u00a0If you&#8217;re root you can use any SSH agent.<\/p>\n<p>SSH agents listen on a unix socket. \u00a0You need to figure where this is for each agent (e.g.\u00a0\/tmp\/ssh-tqiEl28473\/agent.28473). You can then use the agent like this:<\/p>\n<pre>export \u00a0SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\/tmp\/ssh-tqiEl28473\/agent.28473\r\nssh-add -l # lists the keys loaded into the agent\r\nssh user@host # will authenticate you if server trusts key in agent<\/pre>\n<p>This command illustrates how you could inspect the environment of every ssh-agent process on a Linux system. \u00a0It should yield a list of unix sockets for SSH agents.<\/p>\n<pre>ps auxeww | grep ssh-agent | grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK | sed 's\/.*SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\/\/' | cut -f 1 -d ' '<\/pre>\n<h3>Agent Forwarding<\/h3>\n<p>If you enable SSH agent forwarding then you&#8217;ll be able to carry on using the SSH agent on your SSH client during your session on the SSH server. \u00a0This is potentially insecure because so will anyone else who is root on the SSH server you&#8217;re connected to. \u00a0Avoid using this feature with any keys you care about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SSH has several features that are useful during pentesting and auditing. \u00a0This page aims to remind us of the syntax for the most useful features.
