										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deanx has release a tool called <a href="http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/application/vessl/">Vessl</a> (Verify SSL).  It&#8217;s a command-line tool which performs a large number of checks on the validity of SSL certificates.</p>
<p>It can check for lots of mundane issue likes expired certs, self signed certificates, etc.  The killer feature for me, though is that it uses a <a href="http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/content/vessl/generating-a-ca-pem-file/">database of PEM files</a> to determine if the site would be trusted by your browser.  It can pretty much answer the question &#8220;If I browse to this site, will my browser throw up a warning message?&#8221;.  This means that on large internal networks, I no longer have to browse to each SSL service to see if would be trusted by my browser.</p>
<p>Checking that SSL certificates are signed by a trusted CA is an important thing to check during a pentest (but possibly one of the most tedious).  If SSL certificates aren&#8217;t signed properly, users will probably get a warning message each time they connect.  They&#8217;ll get used to dismissing these warnings, leaving themselves open to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>Deanx also contributed a <a href="http://pentestmonkey.net/projects/yaptest/yaptest-installation/">Yaptest</a> module to automatically run Vessl against SSL services.  The new module will be included in Yaptest v0.1.6 (not released yet at the time of posting).</p>
